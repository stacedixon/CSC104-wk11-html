Final Project: HTML Coding 1
Overview
By now you should have your case study for the website you want to create which includes the wireframe. For this part of the Final Project, we'll move on to coding.

Guidelines and Expectations
Continue working on your project by setting up your structure in HTML5 documents. Be sure to comment each section and have some kind of "dummy" content in the document so you can see your structure. There should be a sufficient amount of content to clearly show your work and intentions.  Now that you have some experience in this area, I expect you to stretch your skills to new areas. This HTML should look professional, have a sense of completeness like it is showing the entire picture, and show improvements that demonstrate improved skill.
